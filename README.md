# Hostel
Hostel is the Agnel's Boys Hostel Website designed as part of course work during my Undergraduate as a Senior.

## Description
Website contains two pages, the first page is a simple landing page describing the features of the hostel while the second page is a registration page with a fully validated three-part-form.

The frontend is made with bootstrap while backend connection is done using PHP for database connection and jQuery for validation. Javascript is used for animation and some other website functionality.
